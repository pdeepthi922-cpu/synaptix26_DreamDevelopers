PROJECT NAME: SkillBridge
Tagline: Intelligent, Fair, and Transparent Internship & Project Matching

================================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Traditional internship and project allocation systems rely heavily on simple
keyword matching and manual screening, which often fail to accurately evaluate
candidates' true competencies. These approaches can introduce bias, reduce
transparency, and lead to unfair or inefficient opportunity distribution.

SkillBridge is an intelligent, explainable, and fairness-aware platform that
evaluates candidates based on weighted skill competencies, aligns their abilities
with project requirements, and generates a transparent Match Score. The system
clearly explains the reasoning behind each ranking and recommendation, enabling
equitable, data-driven, and efficient internship and project matching for both
candidates and organizations.

TECH STACK (Decided)
================================================================================

--- MAIN APPLICATION ---
Frontend    : React + Vite
Backend API : Node.js + Express
ORM         : Prisma
Database    : PostgreSQL
Auth        : JWT + bcrypt
Validation  : Zod
Hosting     : Render (free tier)

--- PYTHON NLP MICROSERVICE (internal, not exposed to frontend) ---
Framework   : FastAPI (Python 3.11)
Resume Parse: pdfminer.six + spaCy (en_core_web_md)
Skill NLP   : spaCy NER + custom skill taxonomy
              (e.g. Flask in resume --> Python inferred as known skill)
Scoring     : Pure Python — weighted skill match with NLP-expanded skills
Hosting     : Render (free tier, second service)

NOTE: The Node.js API is the single entry point for the frontend.
      It forwards resume PDFs and scoring requests to the Python
      microservice internally via HTTP (axios). The Python service
      URL is configured via PYTHON_SERVICE_URL in the Node.js .env.

================================================================================
CORE ALGORITHM — MATCH SCORE
================================================================================

The Match Score is calculated by comparing a candidate's listed skills against
the skills required by a posting. Each required skill has a weight assigned by
the recruiter when posting (on a scale of 1–5, where 5 is most critical).

Score Calculation:
  - For each required skill, check if the candidate has it.
  - If yes, multiply the candidate's proficiency level (1–5) by the skill weight.
  - Sum all matched scores and divide by the maximum possible score (all skills
    matched at max proficiency) to get a percentage.

Example:
  Posting requires: Python (weight 5), Django (weight 4), SQL (weight 3)
  Candidate has:    Python (proficiency 4), SQL (proficiency 3)
  Score = ((4×5) + (3×3)) / ((5×5) + (5×4) + (5×3)) × 100
        = (20 + 9) / (25 + 20 + 15) × 100 = 29/60 × 100 ≈ 48%

Eligibility Threshold: 80% (fixed, not configurable per posting in v1)

Score Caching:
  - A score is stored in the database the first time a candidate checks
    eligibility for a posting.
  - If the candidate updates their profile later, the cached score is marked
    stale and recalculated automatically the next time they view that posting.

Gap Guidance (when score < 80%):
  - The system identifies missing or low-proficiency skills.
  - It suggests specific sub-skills to learn (e.g., "Learn Django to improve
    your Python score for this posting").
  - It shows the projected score if the candidate learns the suggested skills.

================================================================================
INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS (First Login)
================================================================================

On first login, the dashboard shows "Recommended Internships" and "Recommended
Projects" based on simple keyword matching between the candidate's listed skills
and the skills required in each posting.

Fallback: If the candidate has no skills listed yet (e.g., resume parse failed
or they skipped skills), the system shows the 10 most recently posted listings
as default recommendations.

Pre-seeded Listings: The platform will have a small set of sample internships
and projects seeded in the database so new candidates see content even before
any recruiter has posted.

================================================================================
NOTIFICATIONS
================================================================================

Notifications are in-app only (no email in v1).
When a recruiter clicks "Notify" on a candidate from the ranking view, that
candidate receives an in-app notification: "You have been shortlisted for
[Internship/Project Name]. Apply now."
A notification badge/count will appear in the candidate's dashboard navbar.

================================================================================
VISIBILITY & PRIVACY
================================================================================

Rankings are semi-public within the platform:
  - Candidates CAN see the ranked list of all candidates who checked eligibility
    for a posting (including names and scores). This is by design to encourage
    transparency and self-improvement.
  - Recruiters see the same ranked list.

================================================================================
APPLICATION RULES
================================================================================

  - Candidates CAN withdraw an application (un-apply) before the deadline.
  - Pagination: 10 items per page on all list views.
  - Profile photo: Not required in v1.
  - Search: Basic search by name/keyword on internship and project list pages.

================================================================================
APPLICATION FLOW
================================================================================

--- LANDING PAGE ---

A public-facing landing page that explains what SkillBridge does and why it
exists. It contains a navbar with "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons. The page
describes the problem being solved and the key features of the platform.

--- SIGNUP ---

On the signup page, the user selects "Type of user" from a dropdown (Candidate
or Recruiter). After clicking Sign Up:
  - If user already exists → show error: "User already exists — please click
    here to go to the login page."
  - If user does not exist → create account and proceed to onboarding.

================================================================================
CANDIDATE FLOW
================================================================================

--- ONBOARDING ---

After signup, the candidate sees a "User Data Collection" page with two options:
  1. Enter manually
  2. Upload resume (PDF — system parses and auto-populates form fields;
     candidate can review and edit before saving)

Manual Entry Sections (in order, each transitions after completion):
  1. Personal Details (mandatory): name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn URL
